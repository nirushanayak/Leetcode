1. Linked List:
  
  use dummyNode whereever possible

  use in temr sof partition, make sure of same linked list but create different pointers, ref: partitionList prob 86


2. Stack:
    For algorithm problems, a stack is a good option whenever you can recognize the LIFO pattern. Usually, there will be some component of the problem that involves elements in the input interacting with each other. Interacting could mean matching elements together, querying some property such as "how far is the next largest element", evaluating a mathematical equation given as a string, just comparing elements against each other, or any other abstract interaction.
